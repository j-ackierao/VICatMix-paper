# VICatMix-paper
Code and data to reproduce results from VICatMix paper.

Each simulation scenario and each study on real-world data is separated into folders, with data files, code for any data pre-processing needed, code to produce the results, and code to produce the plot.

The code used in all simulations is contained in the folder VICatMix-code, where "Variational Mixture Model.R" is the main code for VICatMix without variable selection, and "VariationalMixtureModelVarSel" is the main code for VICatMix with variable selection. These both source "E Step", "M Step", and "ELBO Calc" R code files as well as Cpp functions for the variational algorithm. All functions used are identical to those used in the VICatMix R package.

Sample data in simulation scenarios is generated by the R file 'GenerateSampleData.R', located in the folder VICatMix-code.
